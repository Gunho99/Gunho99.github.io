    <h1>My Favorite Pianist</h1>
    <p class="intro">One of my favorite pianists is <strong>Yiruma</strong>, a South Korean pianist and composer. He was born in Korea, and started learning piano at the age of five. He moved to the United Kingdom where he graduated from King's College London. Yiruma released his debut album, <em>Love Scene (2021)</em>, after returning to Korea. His 2011 album <em>The Best: Reminiscent, 10th Anniversary</em> debuted at number three in the Billboard classical charts, and eventually reached number one two weeks later.</p><br>
    <br>
    <p class="intro">I was introduced to his music when I was in middle school. Yiruma's song came out in a library when I was doing my homework, and I fell in love with the song so searched for it to found out later that it was Yiruma's <em>River flows in You (2001)</em>. Since then I have been occasionally listening to his music when studying or when taking a rest. I really like his style in which both folk-pop and minimalistic piano are blended. It personally feels more dynamic than classical piano, but more minimal and peaceful than pop and folk piano. I feel comfortable and calm whenever I listen to his songs. <span>My favorite album of his is currently <em>Love Scene (2021)</em> as I am never tired of listening to its songs after all these years.</span></p><br>
